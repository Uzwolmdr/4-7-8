<h1>The Power of Positive Affirmations for a Calmer Mind</h1>
<p class="intro">Anxiety often feeds on negative self-talk and catastrophic thinking. We tell ourselves we're not good enough, that we'll fail, or that something terrible is about to happen. This constant internal monologue of fear can be a major driver of our anxiety. Positive affirmations, simple and powerful statements that you repeat to yourself, can be a potent antidote. They are a way of consciously and intentionally retraining your brain to focus on hope, strength, and resilience instead of fear.</p>
