<h2>The Science of "Green Therapy"</h2>

<p>Ecopsychology and environmental psychology both study the connections between humans and nature. Studies repeatedly show that natural environments promote recovery from stress, improve mood, and restore attention. These effects occur across cultures and contexts, making nature a universal, low-cost intervention for mental health.</p>

<p>Remembering small positive nature encounters builds resilience and gratitude. Remembering small positive nature encounters builds resilience and gratitude. Ecotherapy approaches integrate guided practices with nature exposure for therapy. Forest bathing involves slow, intentional time among trees to restore attention. Physical movement outdoors adds cardiovascular and mood benefits to time in nature. Mindful attention to natural details increases presence and reduces rumination. Forest bathing involves slow, intentional time among trees to restore attention. Nature connects people to a larger scale, which reduces self-focused worry. (Science of Green Therapy)</p>

<p>Nature exposure promotes better sleep patterns by regulating circadian cues. Seasonal awareness adds rhythm and meaning to nature practices.
