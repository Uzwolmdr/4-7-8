<h2>Quick Mindfulness Scripts You Can Use (Short Practices)</h2>
<p>Below are short, copy-ready scripts to use immediately when you need a quick anchor.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>One-Minute Breath Anchor:</strong> "Stop. Feet on the floor. Take three slow breaths. Notice the in and out of the breath."</li>
<li><strong>Two-Minute Grounding:</strong> "Name five things you can see, four you can touch, three you can hear, two you can smell, one you can taste."</li>
<li><strong>Gentle Body Scan (5 Minutes):</strong> "Shift attention through the body from toes to head, softening each area."</li>
<li><strong>Self-Compassion Pause:</strong> "Place a hand on your heart. Breathe toward your hand. Say silently: 'May I be safe. May I be kind to myself.'"</li>
</ul>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions About Mindfulness and Anxiety</h2>
<dl>
<dt>Will mindfulness make my anxiety worse?</dt>
<dd>In rare cases, practicing mindfulness can bring up difficult emotions. This is why gradual practice, guidance, and choosing appropriate supports is important. If you notice increased distress, pause the practice and seek professional support.</dd>

<dt>How long before I notice benefits?</dt>
<dd>Many people notice small improvements in mood and focus within a few weeks of consistent practice. More substantial shifts often require months of regular practice.</dd>

<dt>Can mindfulness replace medication?</dt>
<dd>Mindfulness can be a powerful complement to therapy and medication but should not be considered a direct replacement without consultation with a qualified clinician.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Short Guided Practices (Text Versions You Can Read)</h2>
<p><strong>3‑Minute Anchor:</strong> Sit comfortably. Close your eyes if it feels safe. Take three deep breaths, then breathe naturally. Count the incoming breath 'one', the outgoing 'two' up to three, then back to one. If your mind wanders, gently return to counting.</p>

<p><strong>5‑Minute Body Scan:</strong> Lie or sit comfortably. Bring attention to your feet. Notice sensations, temperature, pressure. Move slowly upward through ankles, calves, knees, thighs, pelvis, belly, chest, hands, arms, shoulders, neck, face, and head. At each area, breathe into tension and allow it to soften.</p>
